# Wireless-Perf-Sim
Project for implementing a simulation framework for testing Ad Hoc End to End performance. This framework will check system throughput and end to end latency, jitter, throughput, and other relevant stats such as packet drop rate . The goal is to assist network design for high performance IoT systems such as connected vehicles or high throughput IoT devices such as cameras.
